Hello Visitors!

I have built a machine learning model for diabetes prediction using a patient dataset from Kaggle.

This project demonstrates the application of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on their health metrics. Developed in Python, the model showcases data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to provide insights into diabetes risk assessment.

Project Overview:
Loading and preprocessing data
Training an SVM model on the dataset
Evaluating the model's performance
Making predictions based on new data

The model achieves a Training Data accuracy of 78.66% and a Testing Data accuracy of 77.27%.
